# Mubs-Projects

This repository contains various Python projects related to data science, statistics, and machine learning. Each project demonstrates different algorithms, statistical tests, and real-world applications, providing insights into different aspects of programming and data analysis.

## Projects

### 1. **Chi Square Test**
   - Performs the Chi-square test for categorical data to test the independence of two variables.

### 2. **Correlation**
   - Implements various correlation techniques to analyze relationships between datasets (e.g., Pearson, Spearman).

### 3. **Kruskal-Wallis Test**
   - Performs the Kruskal-Wallis H-test for comparing multiple independent samples, an alternative to one-way ANOVA.

### 4. **Paired Sample Sign Test**
   - A non-parametric test used to compare two related samples.

### 5. **Random Password Generator**
   - A Python program to generate secure random passwords with customizable lengths and character types.

### 6. **Regression Analysis**
   - Implements linear regression models for predictive analysis and forecasting.

### 7. **Search Engine**
   - A basic search engine application that uses web scraping techniques to fetch data from websites.

### 8. **Semantic Segmentation**
   - Uses image processing and deep learning models for segmenting images into meaningful parts.

### 9. **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and Rank-Sum Tests**
   - Implements non-parametric Wilcoxon tests to compare two related or independent samples.

### 10. **Web Crawling**
   - A Python program for crawling and scraping data from websites, useful for gathering large amounts of data.

### 11. **Voice Assistant**
   - A voice-controlled assistant using Python and speech recognition, capable of performing various tasks.

### 12. **Weather App**
   - Fetches weather data from APIs and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## Installation

To get started with these projects, you'll need Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website:

- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once you have Python installed, you can set up the required dependencies for each project:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mubashiruddi/Mubs-Projects.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Mubs-Projects
    ```

3. Install the required libraries (if available, usually listed in `requirements.txt` or individual project files):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each project is self-contained, and the main code is usually in a `.py` file. You can run any project as follows:

```bash
python project_name.py
